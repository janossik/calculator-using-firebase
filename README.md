# Calculator-using-firebase

This app is a simple calculator app that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations. It also has a history feature that allows you to see your previous calculations. Used technologies: React, TypeScript, Firebase, React Router, Material UI and more. If you want to check the app, you can find it [here](https://hr-me-calculator.web.app)

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to write tests for this app, but I will definitely do it in the future.

if you want to run this app locally, you need to do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal
3. Create a firebase project and add a web app to it (functions working only on the blaze plan :c)
4. Add environment variables to your project. You can find them in the .env.example file
